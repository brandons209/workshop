**Here are some download links to programs that you may need in your future coding career.**

For my lectures and if you want to start programming in C++ on your **WINDOWS** computer:  
[Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)  
[Java JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk9-downloads-3848520.html)  
[Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages/) _Make sure to download the latest package for C++!_  
[MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/)  

For compiling C++ on your **macOS** computer, you only need Eclipse and Java, not MinGW.
