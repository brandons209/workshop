### C++ Tutorials
- [Bucky's C++ Tutorial Series on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvC1WCdV1XU&list=PLAE85DE8440AA6B83)
	- This tutorial series is what got me into programming quite a long time ago; it will bring you from zero to hero!
- [Eclipse C++ and MinGW Installation on Windows](https://goo.gl/m3Xxpd)
	- This is a tutorial to get Eclipse C++ and MinGW compiler on windows; this is a nice IDE and compiler to run code on your computer!
	- You can use eclipse instead of Code Blocks, which is what Bucky uses in his tutorials.
	- [Getting Started with Eclipse C++ Tutorial](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/EclipseCpp_HowTo.html)
		- Another tutorial I found that may be helpful for Eclipse C++.  

### Python Tutorials
Python is quite an easier programming language to learn and master than C++ as your first language, and it is used almost everywhere.  
I highly suggest you take some time to look over these tutorials and learn some basic Python.  
- [Automate the boring stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com)
	- This book is made to teach someone with minimal to no programming expierence to programming wizard, and its free!
	- There is an online video series that goes over each chapter in the book: [Link Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F_OgqRuSdI&list=PL0-84-yl1fUnRuXGFe_F7qSH1LEnn9LkW)
		- This only covers the first few chapters however, you can buy the full video course for 10 dollars [here](https://www.udemy.com/automate/?couponCode=FOR_LIKE_10_BUCKS).
